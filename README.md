# Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly effective for problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. By solving each subproblem once and storing its solution, DP avoids the need for redundant calculations, significantly improving efficiency.

## Application of Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is widely utilized in various fields, including:

- **Computer Science:** Algorithm design, optimization problems, artificial intelligence.
- **Operations Research:** Resource allocation, scheduling problems.
- **Economics:** Optimal strategies in decision making, game theory.
- **Bioinformatics:** Sequence alignment, gene prediction.

## Types of Dynamic Programming

### Top-Down Approach (Memoization)
This approach involves solving the problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It is known as memoization.

### Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
This approach involves solving all possible subproblems starting from the simplest ones and storing their results in a table to build up the solution to the main problem.
